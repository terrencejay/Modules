# Modules
Here we have four files. two of them are modules, and the other two utilize these modules.
The moodresponses.py is the module that will be able to accept the users mood and return a message base on the input used in the main.py file.
the second text_util.py is used to reverse and capitalize strings entered by the user in the util_main.py file.
both of the main files are importing their respective modules and using the function created for the responses.
